# E-Commerce Application

An e-commerce application built with node.js, express.js, sequelize, and SQL

### Description
The attached project file(s) are for our eleventh challenge as part of the UC Berkeley full stack coding bootcamp. The goal of the challenge was to build the back end of an e-commerce application that that has a hierarchy of categories, products, and tags, with each category having one or several products, each product having one or several tags, and vice versa. The application is primarily accessed via API request, using GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE requests.

The project gave me practical experience with an application that demonstrates the relationships one can create between a database and API requests using Sequelize. Additionally, it was an opportunity to test our skills with Seqquelize, such as building models that use existing seed files to populate a SQL database.

### Installation
In order to use the application, clone the GitHub repository link, use MySQL to create the database, use node ./seeds to seed the database, then run npm start to initialize the application, and finally, use an API platform such as Postman or Insomnia to make API requests to the SQL database.

### Usage
This application is free to use.

### Credits
This project was created with helpful collaboration from bootcamp group 3, as well as my instructors, TAs, and my tutor (Erik Hirsch) from UC Berkeley.
